# Project Euler

My answers for Project Euler as a series of commands.

My friend code `1776782_xSSHCm900BUut8c0Iq2yEWo4o0tbBrtk`.

Also, Due to Euler rules only the first 100 will be done and committed.  The rest will be kept private.

# Build / Run

```bash
./run
go run .

# or
go run . p<N>

# Where N is the number of the Euler problem on the site.
```

If the Problem statement is short-ish then it will be included it the help text of the command.

```bash
go run . p1 -h
Problem 1

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
